                    I'm Devin Kott, a computer scientist from Rochester, New York
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I recently graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology with both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science, focusing on security (May 2021).
                    My goal in my career is to get started learning about modern technologies that cross with my interests: sustainability, anything space related, and automation systems to name a few.
                    I find all of these topics fascinating and would love to contribute to either new or existing solutions.

                    More about me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy messing around with home automation, fixing iPhones, rock climbing, playing volleyball, riding motorcycles, flying drones, photography, and learning French.
                    Here are some of the technologies and hardware I use: Linux Mint, Windows, NUC10i5, Synology DS218, Netgear Orbi, proxmox, Xiaomi, PiHole, TickTick.
                    I use a few AWS services as well: Amplify, Route 53, CloudFront, S3, Lambda.
                    My NUC10i5 runs proxmox with several containers for various services, including HomeAssistant, Plex, bitwarden, and caddy.
